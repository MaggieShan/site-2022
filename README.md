# Maggie Shan's Portfolio Website
V4 2022

This site is a means to: explore different frontend frameworks/libraries, showcase my skills and projects, and play around with my own creativity. 

Every year I like to revamp my site with new designs and frameworks to further develop the new skills/tools I've learned. In this version, I specifically explore: 

* 3D modeling with ThreeJS (React Three Fiber) and Blender
* Styled Components 


### Notes
* Using Next Three Fiber Starter: https://github.com/aliiscript/next-r3f-starter
